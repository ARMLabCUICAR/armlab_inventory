# Description
Diamond-MM-32-AT PC/104 is a Cheap analog I/O module that has a lot of features for its price.

# Features
## Automatic calibration
Diamond-MM-32 is the first PC/104 analog I/O board to feature automatic calibration of both analog inputs and outputs for enhanced accuracy and reliability. The potentiometers, which are subject to tampering and vibration, have been eliminated. Instead, all A/D calibration adjustments are performed using an octal 8-bit DAC. The DAC values are stored in an EEPROM and are recalled automatically on power up. The board includes three precision voltage references for negative full scale, zero, and positive full-scale. A calibration utility program provided with the board allows you to recalibrate the board anytime, in both unipolar and bipolar modes, and store the new settings in EEPROM.

Auto calibration applies to the 4 D/A channels as well. The full-scale D/A range is selected with a jumper block. The analog outputs are fed back to the A/D converter so they can be calibrated without user intervention. Again, calibration settings are stored in EEPROM and automatically recalled on power-up
## Analog Inputs
**Enhanced Analog Input Configuration**
Virtually all other A/D boards require you to set all input channels in one mode, either single-ended or differential. Diamond-MM-32 provides split configuration capability, with more total input channels than any other PC/104 analog I/O board. The board can be user-configured in any of three ways:
