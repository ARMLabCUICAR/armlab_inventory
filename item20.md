## Description

The Stamp PAK Vb is a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) coprocessor. It has an easy-to-use serial interface that allows it to connect to a variety of microcontrollers including the Parallax Basic Stamp.
The PAK Vb can generate 8 channels of PWM at one time using one of two methods, proportional PWM and equal area PWM.

## Features

* Serial interface uses TTL level RS232 at 9600 or 2400 baud (true or inverted)
* Uses as few as 1 pin to connect to the host
* Can connect multiple devices to the same pin with one additional pin per device
* Asynchronous operation - all 8 channels active at one time with no overhead on host computer
* The PAK-Vc can share a single pin with 31 other PAK-Vc chips (a total of 32 chips and 256 outputs).
