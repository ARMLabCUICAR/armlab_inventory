### Infrared Control and Communications

[IR Buddy Demo Kit user manual](http://www2.elo.utfsm.cl/~mineducagv/docs/ListaDetalladadeModulos/Docum_IRB.pdf)

## Description

The IR Buddy is an intelligent peripheral that allows the BASIC Stamp to transmit and receive infrared control codes, and communicate (send/receive data packets) with other BASIC Stamps â€“ all through a single I/O pin and without wires between devices. The IR Buddy has onboard IR transmit and receive hardware, as well as a communications controller that buffers incoming signals and manages data exchange with the BASIC Stamp.
