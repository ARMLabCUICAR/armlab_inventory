## Description

The EPM-SVGA-2 module combines a high speed SVGA interface for PC/104-Plus systems with an on-board DiskOnChip site for non-volatile system storage. It is fully compatible with popular operating systems such as QNX, Windows CE, NT, Win95/98 and VxWorks.
The video section features outputs for standard display monitors and for flat panel displays (optional). A wide selection of operating modes allows the display to be tailored to a variety of OEM requirements.
One MB of on-board video RAM (standard) allows color depth up to 16M colors and screen resolutions up to 1280 x 1024 pixels. Two MB of RAM (optional) allows screen resolutions up to 1600 x 1200 pixels.
The DiskOnChip (DOC) site allows the use of plug-in non-volatile solid state Flash storage. Combining both video and Flash expansion on a single module provides cost and space savings for systems that do not have adequate Flash capacity. Under most operating systems, the DOC supports normal file reads and writes, as well as system booting, from the totally non-volatile solid state storage.
The EPM-SVGA-2 features high reliability design and construction, along with 48-hour burn-in and 100% functional testing. It is backed by a two-year limited warranty and VersaLogic’s outstanding service and support. The EPM-SVGA-2 is a PC/104-Plus compliant Super VGA display module with a single chip VGA controller, up to 2 megabytes of vram (1 MB standard), flat panel support (optional), and DiskOnChip site for system Flash memory support. The card’s VGA BIOS and software provide support for Windows 3.1, 95, and NT installations.
