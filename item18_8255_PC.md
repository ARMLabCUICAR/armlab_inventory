## Description

[Boondog Automation 8255 PC](https://www.boondog.com/tutorials/8255/8255.htm)

The 8255 Programmable Peripheral Interface (PPI) is a versatile and easy to construct circuit card the plugs into an available slot in your IBM PC. Such a card allows you to do both digital input and output (DIO) to your PC. For example, you may want to have your PC turn on a switch, or have a switch electronically activate your PC to execute a program. The 8255 has 3 8-bit TTL-compatiable I/O ports. Thus technically you could control up to 24 individual devices. For example, with the circuit description that follows, you could build a home security device, with a digital input detecting if someone rang your doorbell, and having a digital output turning on a light switch, the other remaining 22 DIOs could then be used to detect for sound detection (broken glass say), doors being opened, digitally dial 911, detect smoke etc.
