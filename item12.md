## Description

The DM6814/DM5814 incremental encoder dataModule turns your IBM PC-compatible cpuModule or other PC/104 computer into a high-performance control system. The DM5814 and DM6814 are the same board except for the addition of the AT bus connector on the DM6814. This connector allows you to stack the module easily with other AT modules and also allows you access to the AT interrupts. Ultra-compact for embedded and portable applications, the module features:
*	Three 16-bit incremental encoder up/down counters,
*	Three 16-bit timer/counters and on-board 8 MHz clock,
*	Direct connection to opto-22 I/O system modules,
*	Operation from single +5V supply,
*	DOS example programs with source code in BASIC and C,
*	Diagnostics software.

Depending on your specifications when ordering your DM6814/DM5814, your module will have up to three incremental encoder circuits. Each of these circuits has one 16-bit up/down counter for incremental encoding applications such as position encoding and velocity detection, and eight digital I/O lines available for control functions. Six lines are input only, and two are input/output. An 8254 programmable interval timer provides three 16-bit, 8 MHz timer/counters to support a wide range of user timing and counting functions.


## Installation Guide

Keep the module in its antistatic bag until you are ready to install it in your cpuModule or other PC/104 based system. When removing it from the bag, hold the module at the edges and do not touch the components or connectors.
Before installing the module in your system, check the jumper and switch settings. Chapter 1 reviews the factory settings and how to change them. If you need to change any settings, refer to the appropriate instructions in Chapter 1. Note that incompatible jumper settings can result in unpredictable module operation and erratic response.
The DM6814/DM5814 comes with a stackthrough P1 connector. The stackthrough connector lets you stack another module on top of your DM6814/DM5814. To install the module, follow the procedures described in the computer manual and the steps below:
1.	Turn OFF the power to your system.
2.	Touch a metal rack to discharge any static buildup and then remove the module from its antistatic bag.
3.	Select the appropriate standoffs for your application to secure the module when you install it in your system (two sizes are included with the module).
4.	Holding the module by its edges, orient it so that the P1 bus connectorÂ’s pin 1 lines up with pin 1 of the expansion connector onto which you are installing the module.
5.	After carefully positioning the module so that the pins are lined up and resting on the expansion connector, gently and evenly press down on the module until it is secured on the connector.
NOTE: Do not force the module onto the connector. If the module does not readily press into place, remove it and try again. Wiggling the module or exerting too much pressure can result in damage to the DM6814/DM5814 or to the mating module.
6.	After the module is installed, connect the cables as needed to I/O connector P2, P3, and P6 on the module. When making these connection, note that there is no keying to guide you in orientation. You must make sure that pin 1 of the cable is connected to pin 1 of the connector (pin 1 is marked on the module with a small square). For twisted pair cables, pin 1 is the dark brown wire; for standard single wire cables, pin 1 is the red wire.
7.	Make sure all connections are secure.
